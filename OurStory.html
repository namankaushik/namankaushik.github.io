	<div class="Story">
			<pre>
 It goes back to 2010 when I was in 7th and during that time my grandfather passed away and my mom always used to crib to my grandmother
        about me not liking cooking at all because at that time only thing I can make was tea, coffee, stuffed parathaI didn’t even knew how to cook Maggie
  I always used to say that I would not be able to learn how to cook I don’t like it but that’s where life takes a turn and now I am a future culinarian
my grandmother always wanted me to cook she always used to say girls should know cooking, but I never showed interest in 2011 February she
                        passed away and then in my summer vacations I decided to cook something everyday because she wanted me to learn so my grandmother was the reason
                  I started cooking cooking and slowly slowly I didn’t even realized when I developed such interest in cooking but still I never bothered much I used to like,

                I was good at it that is all I knew my goal was something else completely middle school and joined high school I continued cooking after my high school
                                        I realized that cooking is what I want to do, cooking makes me feel alive and cooking is something I want my future In. I have grown up seeing chef Sanjeev Kapoor’s
                                           (A great Indian chief) show Khana khazana I cannot blame it because I guess that’s what inspired me since childhood watching food shows and even MasterChef India,
                                 I used to have these food magazines always which had so many recipes that was the thing which I loved the most but getting back on my story after high school,
                                           I wanted to pursue it as a career option and wanted to join hotel management but being in a middle class family changing stream from medical to hotel management
          was such a task none in my family allowed me I was forced to take admission in B.SC Biotechnology for 3 years I did that and failed because I couldn't

                                                      do it but all these 3 years the only thing I did was cooking and getting my knowledge in food in February 2019 my father realized that Biotechnology is not something I want to 
                                                                          do but cooking is love for me he permitted me to apply for hotel management and gave a challenge that only if I get admission in top 4th hotel management college that is Dr. Ambedkar 
                                                                            institute of the hotel management and catering nutrition he’ll allow me to stay in Chandigarh otherwise I have to select another college, but I was confident enough that I’ll be able to do it 
                                                                    my entrance exam happened and results came and that moment I cried on seeing my rank because I made it I couldn't be more happier and here it was got admission in top 4th hotel 
                                                                           management college and it has been 1.5 year since then and I’m rocking and proving myself everyday that I’m worthy of it. The COVID-19 happened which made my passion my depression
                                                         as I was not able to go out to college and learn and make stuff but then suddenly one day I thought of making cake at home and it went well and I continued it and few days later <br>
I opened my own little home bakery and named it Chocolate Nation.

 Cooking is what got me out of my depression.

 Now all I say it, cake is my canvas, and I am an artist.
